A Github Post-Receive Hook for AgileZen
=======================================

This is a super simple little Sinatra app to attach comments to an AgileZen board. Right now 
it will only look for comments on a single board.

Requirements
------------

* Ruby
* Sinatra 

You can easily spin up this app on Heroku. 

Usage
-----

Get your API key from AgileZen. It's probably a good idea to create user specifically for
the API and limit the privileges as needed.

Add the post receive hook in Github as follows.

```
https://wherever.com/?project_id=123&api_key=12342k3j4b287zs9d8vzsv9
```

Push commits to your Github repo with commit message that contains `/(?:task|story|card) #?(\d+)/i` and you'll see the commit appear in AgileZen.

To Do
-----
* Get the API key out of the query string. I don't really know a better way to do it right now.
* Check for the presence of the story before trying to add the comment, instead of letting it fail if it doesn't exist
